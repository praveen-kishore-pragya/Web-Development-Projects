For practise of HTML, CSS and JS, I have done some hobby projects, which maybe requiring some slight modifiactions, but as beginner it's a great fun learning the things.

The projects are:

1.  Spotify - Clone
2.  Analog Clock
3.  Car Animation
4.  Save the T-Rex! - Game
5.  Snake Mania
6.  Weather App
